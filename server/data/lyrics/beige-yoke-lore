I don't wanna see you smile
I want you in the morning
Before you go performing
Tell me something I don't know
And lead me to the place where no one ever goes
Let me go under your skin
Let me find the demons that drive those heavenly limbs
You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul what you got 'cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults
So please don't let me fall
So please don't let me fall
And I think we'd survive in the wild
We would eat plants and roots and dream about electric fans
Baby, could you kill a man?
Could you look in his eyes and feel the fire drain out of his hands?
Baby do you think about the past?
Do you wonder if every stupid little thing has led us to this
You know you're beautiful
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul what you got 'cause I want it all
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults
So please don't let me fall
So please don't let me fall
You know you're beautiful (you're beautiful)
But that ain't half the gold treasure in your soul what you got 'cause I want it all (want it all)
With your fingers in my mouth, I fail to see your faults
So please don't let me fall
So please don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
